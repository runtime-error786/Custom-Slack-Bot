# Custom-Slack-Bot


The Custom-Slack-Bot  Slack Bot is an intelligent chatbot integrated with Slack, designed to handle user queries efficiently by leveraging advanced backend technologies. Built with Django Rest Framework, the bot listens for mentions in Slack channels, processes user queries, and forwards them to a custom /chat API endpoint for natural language understanding. The bot utilizes ChromaDB for semantic search and knowledge retrieval, allowing it to generate accurate and context-aware responses. Communication between Slack and the backend is facilitated via ngrok, providing a secure and temporary public URL for testing and development. With robust features like Slack's event subscription for real-time interactions, URL verification, and external API communication, the bot serves as a highly interactive and intelligent solution. It ensures seamless deployment and query handling, making it ideal for use cases requiring conversational AI integrated into Slack environments.
